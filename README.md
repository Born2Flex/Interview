# Interview

Interview management System is designed to simplify the interview process, making it more efficient and convenient for both interviewers and candidates. 

Users can select and manage their skills with special skill-tree structure. Interview process is conducted based on the skills that intersects between the interviewer and the candidate. 
During interview interviewers can select questions from a pool of saved ones, according to the skill, or generate new questions using the OpenAI API. Also, interviewer can quickly grade candidates' responses and provide immediate feedback in form of a grade from 0 to 100. 
After the interview, interviewers provide detailed feedback to candidates where they write their impression and advices for improvement, candidates can then view their results and gain insights about their performance. 

Future enhancements include implementing candidate search functionality based on skills and developing a graphical user interface to improve user experience.
